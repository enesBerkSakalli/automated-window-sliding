### 3. Genotype Distribution
The dataset contains 11 different norovirus genotypes:

| Genotype             | Count | Percentage |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| GII.P7-GII.6         | 12    | 27.3%      |
| GII.P4-GII.4         | 11    | 25.0%      |

### 4. Sequence Quality Assessment

#### Start/End Patterns
- **Most common start pattern:** AAACAATGATACCACACTCC (22.7% of sequences)
- **Start pattern diversity:** 20 different start patterns detected
- **End pattern diversity:** Multiple end patterns observed
- **ATG start codons:** 0/44 sequences (0%) - sequences likely partial or trimmed

#### Reading Frame Analysis
- **Average stop codons in best frame:** 2.7%
- **Stop codon range:** 1.2% - 4.4%
- **Interpretation:** Moderate stop codon content suggests some potential frameshifts or sequencing artifacts

#### Quality Issues Detected
1. **Length outliers:** 2 sequences significantly shorter than average
2. **High start pattern diversity:** May require trimming for optimal alignment
3. **No ATG start codons:** Indicates partial sequences or trimmed 5' ends

## Genotype-Specific Insights

The presence of multiple norovirus genotypes (GII.P7-GII.6 and GII.P4-GII.4 being most prevalent) suggests this dataset represents diverse norovirus strains. This diversity should be considered during:
- Alignment parameter selection
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Sliding window analysis

## Recommendations for Alignment

### Pre-alignment Steps
1. **Review length outliers:** Consider excluding or separately analyzing the 2 shorter sequences
2. **Sequence trimming:** Given the diverse start patterns, consider trimming 5' and 3' ends to common regions
3. **Quality filtering:** Consider removing sequences with high stop codon content if protein-coding analysis is intended

### Alignment Strategy
1. **Use progressive alignment:** Given the sequence diversity across genotypes
2. **Consider genotype-specific alignment:** Group sequences by genotype for initial alignment, then combine
3. **Codon-aware alignment:** If analyzing protein-coding regions, use codon-aware alignment tools
4. **Gap penalty adjustment:** Use moderate gap penalties to account for length variation

### Sliding Window Analysis Considerations
1. **Window size:** Given the mean sequence length of ~509 bp, consider window sizes of 50-100 bp
2. **Step size:** Use step sizes of 10-25 bp for adequate resolution
3. **Genotype stratification:** Consider running separate analyses for major genotype groups
4. **Conserved region identification:** No highly conserved regions >15 bp found, suggesting high variability

## Conclusion

The norovirus sequence dataset shows moderate diversity with multiple genotypes represented. While sequence quality is generally good, the presence of length outliers and diverse start patterns suggests careful pre-processing will be beneficial before alignment. The lack of highly conserved regions indicates this dataset will be suitable for sliding window analysis to detect regions of varying evolutionary pressure.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with sequence trimming and alignment using the recommendations above, considering genotype-specific analysis for optimal results.
