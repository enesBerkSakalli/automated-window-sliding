# Norovirus Sequence Alignment Enhancement Report

## Dataset Overview
- **Total sequences:** 44
- **Length range:** 437 - 517 bp
- **Mean length:** 508.5 Â± 17.7 bp
- **Genotypes:** 11 unique ({'GII.P7-GII.6': 12, 'GII.P4-GII.4': 11, 'Unknown': 7})

## Identified Challenges
Based on our sequence analysis, the following challenges were identified:

1. **Length outliers:** 7 sequences with extreme lengths
   - KR074184.1: 479 bp
   - KR074185.1: 479 bp
   - KR074186.1: 437 bp
   - KR074187.1: 437 bp
   - KR074188.1: 517 bp
   - KR074189.1: 517 bp
   - KR074191.1: 492 bp

2. **Genotype diversity:** 11 different genotypes
   - This suggests high sequence divergence requiring careful alignment

3. **GC content variation:** 9.0% range
   - May indicate compositional bias affecting alignment

## Enhancement Strategy
Our multi-step enhancement approach addresses these challenges:

### Step 1: Quality Filtering
- Remove sequences with extreme lengths (bottom 5%)
- Filter sequences with excessive ambiguous nucleotides
- Retain high-quality sequences for alignment

### Step 2: Sequence Trimming
- Remove variable start/end regions (15 bp each end)
- Focus on conserved core regions
- Reduce alignment artifacts from partial sequences

### Step 3: Genotype-Specific Alignment
- Align sequences within genotype groups first
- Reduces impact of high divergence between genotypes
- Improves local alignment accuracy

### Step 4: Alignment Merging
- Combine genotype-specific alignments
- Maintain within-group alignment quality
- Create comprehensive master alignment

### Step 5: Gap Refinement
- Remove columns with >60% gaps
- Focus on informative alignment regions
- Improve signal-to-noise ratio

### Step 6: Quality Assessment
- Calculate conservation scores
- Assess pairwise sequence identity
- Generate quality visualizations

## Recommended Tools
For optimal results, we recommend:

1. **MAFFT** - Fast and accurate for large datasets
2. **MUSCLE** - Good balance of speed and accuracy
3. **Clustal Omega** - High accuracy for divergent sequences

## Expected Outcomes
This enhancement approach should result in:

- **Improved conservation scores** in functional regions
- **Reduced gap artifacts** from sequence length variation
- **Better phylogenetic signal** for downstream analysis
- **Optimal window selection** for sliding window analysis

## Next Steps
After enhanced alignment:

1. **Validate alignment quality** using multiple metrics
2. **Identify conserved regions** for primer design
3. **Set sliding window parameters** based on alignment length
4. **Consider phylogenetic analysis** to understand relationships
