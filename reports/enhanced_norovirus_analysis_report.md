# Enhanced Norovirus Recombination Analysis: Dataset Characterization and Methodological Framework

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive phylogenetic and recombination analysis of 86 norovirus sequences from Brazil, spanning 2004-2016, optimized for sliding window analysis of recombination patterns. The dataset integrates sequences from two major epidemiological studies, focusing on the ORF1/ORF2 junction region where recombination events are most prevalent. Using optimized sliding window parameters (250 bp windows, 10 bp steps) and advanced phylogenetic reconstruction methods, this analysis framework provides enhanced resolution for detecting recombination breakpoints and understanding norovirus evolutionary dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

Noroviruses are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis globally, with genogroup II (GII) strains being responsible for the majority of human infections. A defining characteristic of norovirus evolution is the high frequency of recombination events, particularly at the junction between ORF1 (encoding nonstructural proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and ORF2 (encoding the major capsid protein VP1) (Bull et al., 2012; Fumian et al., 2016). Understanding these recombination patterns is crucial for tracking viral evolution, predicting outbreak dynamics, and informing public health responses.

Brazil represents a critical geographic region for norovirus surveillance due to its diverse population, varied climatic conditions, and documented circulation of multiple genotypes. Previous studies have identified Brazil as a hotspot for norovirus recombination, with several novel recombinant strains first detected in Brazilian populations (Fumian et al., 2016). The temporal and geographic sampling available from Brazilian surveillance efforts provides an exceptional opportunity to study recombination dynamics over an extended period.

## 2. Dataset Composition and Sources

### 2.1 Primary Data Sources

Our dataset comprises 86 high-quality norovirus sequences derived from two complementary epidemiological studies conducted in Brazil:

#### 2.1.1 Southern Brazil Recombinant Strains (2004-2011)
**Source**: Fumian et al. (2016)  
**Accession Range**: KR074148-KR074191 (44 sequences)  
**Geographic Coverage**: Southern Brazil  
**Temporal Range**: 2004-2011  
**Sequence Type**: Partial 3'-ORF1 and 5'-ORF2 junction region  

This foundational study represents the first comprehensive characterization of norovirus recombinant strains in Brazil. The authors identified eight distinct recombinant NoV strains responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks across southern Brazilian states. The high prevalence of recombinant strains (>50% of sequenced samples) demonstrated the significant role of recombination in norovirus evolution within this geographic region.

#### 2.1.2 Espírito Santo State Emergence Study (2015-2016)
**Source**: PLoS One. 2017;12(12):e0189504  
**Accession Ranges**: KY451971-KY451987, MF158177-MF158199, KY551568-KY551569  
**Geographic Coverage**: Espírito Santo State, Southeastern Brazil  
**Temporal Range**: 2015-2016  
**Sequence Type**: Nonstructural polyprotein and VP1 genes, partial cds  

This study documented the emergence and characterization of the novel recombinant norovirus GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney variant in southeastern Brazil. The detection of this recombinant strain, which subsequently became globally dominant, highlights the importance of Brazilian surveillance in tracking norovirus evolution.

### 2.2 Quality Control and Dataset Optimization

#### 2.2.1 Sequence Filtering
Initial dataset contained 88 sequences, reduced to 86 following quality control:
- **Removed sequences**: MF681695.1 and MF681696.1 (VP1-only sequences with excessive leading gaps)
- **Retention criteria**: Complete ORF1/ORF2 junction coverage, <95% gap content

#### 2.2.2 Alignment Optimization
- **Original alignment length**: 1,857 positions
- **Optimized alignment length**: 516 positions (72.2% reduction)
- **Gap reduction**: From variable gap content to 5.29% overall
- **Phylogenetically informative sites**: 254 positions (49.22%)

#### 2.2.3 Genogroup Diversity
The final dataset represents 17 unique norovirus genogroups:
- **Major recombinant types**: GII.P7-GII.6, GII.P7-GII.14, GII.Pe-GII.17, GII.P13-GII.17
- **Emerging variants**: GII.P16-GII.4, GII.P16-GII.3
- **Rare recombinants**: GII.Pg-GII.12, GII.P21-GII.21

## 3. Methodological Framework

### 3.1 Sliding Window Analysis Parameters

Based on current literature and the characteristics of our dataset, we implemented optimized sliding window parameters designed to maximize recombination detection sensitivity while maintaining phylogenetic resolution:

```json
{
    "input": "data/cleaned_alignment_combined.fasta",
    "outdir": "results_cleaned_large_windows_250_10",
    "window_size": 250,
    "step_size": 10,
    "run_mode": "full",
    "backbone_midpoint_rooting": true,
    "phylo_method": "iqtree2",
    "model": "GTR+F+I+G4",
