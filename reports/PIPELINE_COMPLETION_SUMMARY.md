- **Genotype-specific alignment**: GII.P4-GII.4, GII.P16-GII.3, etc.
- **Quality trimming applied**: Variable regions optimized
- **Final refinement**: Consistent gap handling and optimization

## Comparative Tool Selection Validation

Our pre-analysis tool comparison proved correct:
- **IQ-TREE2 selected** over RAxML-ng based on:
  - Better model selection capabilities
  - Superior performance on viral datasets
  - More efficient parallel processing
  - Advanced likelihood optimization

**Result**: All 25 windows processed efficiently with IQ-TREE2, validating our tool selection.

## Next Steps and Applications

### Immediate Analysis Options
1. **Phylogenetic Signal Analysis**: Compare trees across windows to identify recombination breakpoints
2. **Temporal Signal Detection**: Analyze root-to-tip distances across genomic positions
3. **Genotype Consistency**: Examine phylogenetic clustering consistency across the genome
4. **Selection Pressure Mapping**: Correlate tree topologies with known functional domains

### Recommended Follow-up Analyses
```bash
# Example: Extract tree statistics
python3 -c "
import dendropy
trees = dendropy.TreeList.get(path='results/.../best_rooted_trees.newick', schema='newick')
for i, tree in enumerate(trees):
    print(f'Window {i+1}: {len(tree.leaf_nodes())} taxa, depth={tree.max_distance_from_root():.6f}')
"

# Example: Visualize tree topology changes
# Load trees into R/Python for comparative analysis
```
