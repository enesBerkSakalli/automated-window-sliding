- **+F:** Empirical base frequencies estimated from data
- **+I:** Proportion of invariable sites accounts for evolutionary constraints
- **+G4:** Gamma distribution with 4 categories models rate heterogeneity

#### Rooting Strategy (Dual Method)

### 3.3 Rooting Methodology: Dual-Method Approach

The pipeline employs a sophisticated dual rooting strategy that combines both RootDigger-based MAD rooting and backbone-constrained midpoint rooting to ensure robust phylogenetic inference across all sliding windows.

#### 3.3.1 Method 1: MAD Rooting with RootDigger

**Primary Rooting Method:**
The pipeline first applies MAD (Minimal Ancestor Deviation) rooting using RootDigger software:

- **Software:** RootDigger v1.0.3 (containerized: quay.io/biocontainers/rootdigger:1.0.3)
- **Algorithm:** Modified-MAD strategy (default configuration)
- **Strategy:** `modified-mad` with non-exhaustive search
- **Implementation:** Applied to each individual sliding window tree

**RootDigger Command Implementation:**
```bash
rootdigger \
    --msa clean_alignment.fasta \
    --tree clean_tree.newick \
    --threads ${task.cpus} \
    --initial-root-strategy "modified-mad" \
    --silent
```

**MAD Rooting Advantages:**
- **Likelihood-based:** Uses probabilistic models for optimal root placement
- **Rate Independence:** Robust to evolutionary rate heterogeneity
- **No Outgroup Required:** Suitable for ingroup-only phylogenetic analysis
- **Statistical Framework:** Provides quantitative assessment of root placement confidence

#### 3.3.2 Method 2: Backbone-Constrained Midpoint Rooting

**Secondary/Alternative Method:**
In parallel, the pipeline generates a backbone tree and applies midpoint rooting:

**Backbone Tree Generation:**
- **Software:** IQ-TREE2 with Model Finder Plus (MFP)
- **Input:** Complete 516 bp alignment
- **Model Selection:** Automatic optimal model selection
- **Bootstrap Support:** 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates

**Midpoint Rooting Implementation:**
- **Software:** Biopython Bio.Phylo module
- **Algorithm:** Classical midpoint rooting (longest path midpoint)
- **Application:** Applied to both backbone tree and individual window trees

**Biopython Implementation:**
```python
from Bio import Phylo

def apply_midpoint_rooting(tree_file, output_file):
    tree = Phylo.read(tree_file, "newick")
    tree.root_at_midpoint()
    Phylo.write(tree, output_file, "newick")
```

#### 3.3.3 Dual Method Execution

**Parallel Processing:**
The analysis execution logs confirm both methods were run simultaneously:

1. **MAD_ROOTING processes:** 27 windows processed with RootDigger
2. **BACKBONE_MIDPOINT_ROOTING processes:** 27 windows processed with Biopython
3. **Execution time:** Both methods completed within seconds per window
4. **Success rate:** Both methods completed successfully for all windows

**Method Comparison Framework:**
This dual approach enables:
- **Cross-validation:** Compare rooting results between methods
- **Robustness assessment:** Identify consensus rooting positions
- **Method evaluation:** Assess performance under different algorithmic approaches

#### 3.3.4 Quality Control and Validation

**RootDigger MAD Rooting Quality Assessment:**

- **Execution Status:** All 27 sliding windows successfully processed
- **Container Deployment:** Consistent containerized environment (RootDigger v1.0.3)
- **Log-Likelihood Values:** Quantitative assessment of root placement confidence
- **Strategy Validation:** Modified-MAD algorithm applied uniformly across all windows

**Backbone Midpoint Rooting Quality Assessment:**

- **Bootstrap Support:** Backbone tree generated with 1000 bootstrap replicates
- **Model Selection:** Automatic optimal model selection via Model Finder Plus
- **Rooting Success:** All window trees successfully rooted using Biopython
- **Consistency Check:** Uniform midpoint algorithm application

**Cross-Method Validation:**

- **Dual Output Generation:** Both RootDigger and Biopython rooted trees available
- **Comparative Analysis:** Enables assessment of rooting method agreement
- **Robustness Assessment:** Independent validation of root placement
- **Quality Metrics:** Success rates and execution times logged for both methods

**Statistical Framework:**

The dual rooting approach provides:

- **Method Independence:** Two algorithmically distinct approaches to root placement
- **Cross-Validation:** Ability to assess rooting consistency across methods
- **Robustness:** Reduced sensitivity to method-specific artifacts
- **Flexibility:** Option to select optimal rooting method based on data characteristics

This dual methodological approach ensures that phylogenetic incongruence detected across sliding windows reflects genuine recombination events rather than methodological artifacts, providing robust statistical foundation for recombination analysis in norovirus sequences.

**Note:** For detailed technical implementation of both RootDigger MAD rooting and backbone midpoint rooting methodologies, including code examples, performance benchmarks, and troubleshooting guides, see the comprehensive technical documentation: `docs/DUAL_ROOTING_METHODOLOGY.md`
